# Shakespeare Sytle Text Generation


## Description
The model is trained on a sample dataset of Shakespeare's works and learns the patterns and structures of his writing. It can then generate new text that resembles Shakespeare's style.


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harisudhan5/shakespeare-style-text-generation-LSTM
cd Shakespeare-poem-generation-LSTM
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
* Open the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) to start working with the model.

* In the Jupyter environment, run each cell sequentially.
* The trained model will be saved after the training process.
* A higher temperature will generate more varied and unpredictable outputs.
* A lower temperature will generate more focused and deterministic outputs.

## Features
* Generates text that mimics Shakespeare's writing style.
* Size of the output text can be altered.
* Customizable temperature parameter to control the randomness and creativity of the generated text.
